### Zinit and Zsh plugins

[How to install Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit)

After installing Zinit:

At the end of `~./zshrc`, after `### End of ZInit's installer chunk`, add this:

```
zinit light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

It will install 3 very useful plugins.

### VSCode terminal

Add this to your VSCode configuration:

`"terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "usr/bin/zsh"`

`usr/bin/zsh` is the path to your zsh. Run `which zsh` to get the path in your terminal.

## Bonus Tip

If you use yarn and you would like to have emojis in your terminal, run this in your brand-new terminal:

`yarn config set -- --emoji true`
